# SharedExperience

 PyTorch implementations for arxiv paper "Audio-driven Talking Face Video Generation with Learning-based Personalized Head Pose"(http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10137) is done in Colab Notebook(Talking Face).
 
Including pre-trained general models and models needed for face reconstruction, identity feature extraction etc
Download from the link provided in Project Report and copy to corresponding subfolders (Audio, Deep3DFaceReconstruction, render-to-video) in Google Drive.
 
 Video then generated was used in UnityProject for the Shared Experience using Wikitude SDk.
 
 Links for all resources are provided in the Project Report.
